<li>	
 <a href="DataSets/traj/taxi.rar"><b>Taxi trajectory data </b></a>, referred to as <b>Taxi</b>, is the GPS trajectories collected by taxies equipped with GPS sensors 
 in Beijing during a period from Nov 1, 2010 to Nov 30, 2010. 
 The sampling rate was one point per minute. Currently, a small part of Taxi (100 trajectories) are available, and a trajectory has 39,100 data points on average. 
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="DataSets/traj/truck.rar"><b> Truck trajectory data  </b></a>, referred to as  <b>Truck</b>, is the GPS trajectories collected by trucks equipped with 
 GPS sensors in China during a period from Aug. 2015 toOct. 2015. The sampling rate varied from 1s to 60s. 
 Currently, a small part of Truck (100 trajectories) are available, and they mostly have around 50 to 90 thousand data points.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
 <b>GeoLife trajectory data </b>, refered to as  <b>GeoLife</b>, is the GPS trajectories collected in GeoLife project by 182 users in
 a period from Apr. 2007 to Oct. 2011. These trajectories have a variety of sampling rates, among which 91% are logged in each 1-5 seconds or each 5-10 meters per point. 
 The longest trajectory has 2,156,994 points. The dataset can be found at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367
<br><br>
</li>

<b>Data Format:</b>
Each taxi or truck trajectory is saved as a separate text file. In these files, a data point is saved as a line with the format:
<em>id;timestamp;latitude;longitude;speed;direction </em>. <br> <br>


Here, (1) <em>id</em>, long, is the id of the moving object, 
(2) <em>timestamp</em>, long, is the timestamp of sampling,
(3) <em>latitude</em>, double, is thelatitude of the moving object at the sampling time,
(4) <em>longitude</em>,double, is thelongitude of the moving object at the sampling time,
(5) <em>speed</em>, double, is the speed (km/h) of the moving object,
(6) <em>direction</em>, double, is the included angle between the heading direction of the vehicle and due north.
