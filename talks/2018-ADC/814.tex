Summary: 
This work presents a system for discovering exceptional facts from knowledge graphs named Maverick, in which a user portal and a cache sever are highlighted.
This demo proposes some interesting ideas, and the technical details are from a SIGMOD 2018 paper by the same authors.


S1. This demo is interesting, and has a few merits from ideas to techniques.

S2. The demonstration plan consists of sufficient cases.






1. The major problem lies in that the demo proposal is not self-explaining, which makes it hard to follow.


For example, in section 2, three exceptionality functions (Isolation, Outlierness and One-of-the-few) are mentioned without definition/illustration.
Dilemma arises as the said research paper is not available for reference for the time being; it is the responsibility of the authors to avoid such dilemma.

2. The demonstration plan should be refined to give a better organization.
